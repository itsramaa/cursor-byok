## [Unreleased]

-

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- Decoupled the default active model from adapter order so Cursor no longer keeps routing new chats to whichever adapter happens to be listed first.
- Added an explicit default active model setting in the dashboard and use it for Cursor model pinning, synthetic model defaults, and fallback request routing.
- Clear specialized/default model selections when their adapter is deleted so config state stays valid.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-22

Initial public release of `cursor-byok`.

### Added

- Local desktop app that turns Cursor IDE into a Bring-Your-Own-Key client.
- On-device HTTPS MITM proxy for the Cursor RPC paths needed by chat, agent, model listing, and default-model hints.
- Synthetic local Pro session injection so Cursor's model picker and agent UI can run without a Cursor account.
- OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic provider support with configurable base URL, API key, and model selection.
- Full agent loop support including tool calls, shell/file tools, MCP tools, plan mode, and streamed responses.
- Wails 3 desktop dashboard with Overview, Models, Stats, and Editor views plus system tray controls.
- Cross-platform Cursor/proxy integration for Windows, macOS, and Linux, including local CA installation flows.
- Per-conversation history and usage stats persisted locally under the app config directory.
